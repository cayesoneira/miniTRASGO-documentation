We are around 5.5 kV.</li> <li>See how temperature, humidity, pressure affect the detector.</li> <li>Study the gas flow: if it is equal, if it decreases with time, which is the optimal value of flux (to save gas if possible).</li> <li>Document all data and software.</li> <li>See if an autocalibration software exists; else, write it. It should use three layers to calibrate the fourth for every layer.</li> <li>Write a visual interface for controlling the voltage, seeing the temperature, etc.</li> <li>Investigate why some strips appear larger.</li> <li>See if it is interesting that some strips are wider than others.</li> <li>Avoid if possible the rel\u00e9 for the future</li> <li>Check the Alberto's power supply. If it works we will not need to change dramatically the architexture for future mingos.</li> <li>Calibrate mingo</li> <li>See why some random maxima in temperature are correlated with maxima at the muon detection. In words of Alberto, sometimes the detector has a general offset. We still do not know where it comes from.</li> <li>Try to guess some physics we could learn from mingo.</li> <li></li> </ul>"}]}
